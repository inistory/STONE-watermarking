# Marking Code Without Breaking It: Code Watermarking for Detecting LLM-Generated Code
<!-- [**ðŸ“– Paper**](https://arxiv.org/) -->

## TL; DR
We propose STONE, a syntax-aware watermarking method that embeds watermarks only in non-syntax tokens to reliably detect AI-generated code without breaking functionality, and introduces CWEM, a comprehensive metric for evaluating code watermark effectiveness.

## About STONE 
**STONE (Syntax TOkeN preserving codE watermarking)** is a robust, syntax-aware watermarking approach designed specifically for code generated by large language models. It strategically embeds watermarks only in non-syntax tokens, preserving critical elements such as keywords, operators, and delimiters, to ensure that the functionality and structural integrity of the code remain intact. By modifying only tokens with minimal impact on code execution, STONE provides a reliable and efficient solution to trace the origin of generated code while maintaining optimal performance.

## About CWEM
**CWEM (Code Watermarking Evaluation Metric)** is a comprehensive framework that objectively assesses watermarking techniques across three key dimensions: correctness, detectability, and naturalness. It quantifies functional correctness using pass@k metrics, evaluates watermark detectability through statistical measures such as z-scores and AUROC, and ensures that the presence of a watermark does not compromise the natural token distribution of code by measuring perplexity. This balanced metric enables clear comparisons among different methods and guides the optimization of watermarking strategies to enhance transparency and accountability in code generated by large language models.

The overall performance of a watermarking technique is evaluated using CWEM, which integrates functional correctness, detectability, and naturalness into a single metric:

</p>

with the condition that 
$\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1$. 

The individual components are defined as follows:

### 1. Correctness

<p align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cmathrm%7BCorrectness%7D%28C_%7Bwm%7D%29%20%3D%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7BC_%7Bwm%7D%7D%5Cleft%5B%201%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cbinom%7Bn%20-%20c%7D%7Bk%7D%7D%7B%5Cbinom%7Bn%7D%7Bk%7D%7D%20%5Cright%5D">
</p>

Correctness evaluates whether the code works correctly before and after watermark insertion.
- $n$: Total number of code samples generated for a given problem
- $c$ : Number of code samples that work correctly
- $\binom{n}{k}$ : Number of ways to choose $k$ samples from $n$ samples
- $\binom{n - c}{k}$ : Number of ways to choose $k$ samples consisting only of incorrect code (i.e., excluding the correct ones)
- Therefore, $1 - \frac{\binom{n - c}{k}}{\binom{n}{k}}$ represents the probability that at least one correct code sample is included when $k$ samples are selected, and the overall correctness score is evaluated as the expectation of this probability over the watermark code set $C_{wm}$.

### 2. Detectability
Detectability evaluates how clearly the watermark is embedded in the code using statistical metrics such as the $z$-score and AUROC.

#### 2-1. $z$-score: Green Token Ratio
<p align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z%28C_%7Bwm%7D%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%7CC_%7Bwm%7D%7C_G%20-%20%5Cgamma%20T%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7BT%20%5Cgamma%20%281%20-%20%5Cgamma%29%7D%7D">
</p>

- $âˆ£C_{wm}âˆ£_G$ : The number of green list tokens in the watermarked code
- $T$ : Total number of tokens in the code
- $\gamma$: Expected proportion of green tokens in non-watermarked code
- The denominator represents the standard deviation under a binomial distribution. 
- $z$-score indicates how many standard deviations the actual count of green tokens deviates from the expected count; a larger value means the watermark is more clearly present.


#### 2-2. Detecting LLM-Generated Code Using the Green Token Ratio
To determine whether the generated code has a watermark, various threshold values $\tau$ are applied to compute the True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR).
- True Positive Rate (TPR): For watermarked code $C_{wm}$, TPR is the proportion of code samples with a $z$-score exceeding the threshold $\tau$.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Ctext%7BTPR%7D%28%5Ctau%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csum_%7Bj%7D%20%5Cmathbf%7B1%7D%28z%28C_%7Bwm%7D%5E%7B%28j%29%7D%29%20%3E%20%5Ctau%29%7D%7B%7C%7BC_%7Bwm%7D%7D%7C%7D">
</p>

- False Positive Rate (FPR): For non-watermarked code 
$C_{H}$, FPR is the proportion of code samples with a 
$z$-score exceeding the threshold $\tau$:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Ctext%7BFPR%7D%28%5Ctau%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csum_%7Bi%7D%20%5Cmathbf%7B1%7D%28z%28C_H%5E%7B%28i%29%7D%29%20%3E%20%5Ctau%29%7D%7B%7C%7BC_H%7D%7C%7D">
</p>

#### 2-3. Overall Detectability Using AUROC
<p align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cmathrm%7BDetectability%7D%28C_%7Bwm%7D%2C%20C_H%29%20%3D%20%5Cint_%7B-%5Cinfty%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D%20%5Ctext%7BTPR%7D%28%5Ctau%29%20%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Ctext%7BFPR%7D%28%5Ctau%29%7D%7Bd%5Ctau%7D%20d%5Ctau">
</p>

- The Detectability score is obtained by integrating the relationship between TPR and FPR over all threshold values $\tau$, which calculates the AUROC.
- An AUROC value close to 1 indicates that the watermark is clearly distinguishable, whereas a value near 0.5 indicates that watermarked and non-watermarked code are difficult to distinguish.
- A high AUROC value demonstrates that the distribution differences of the $z$-scores based on the green token ratio effectively separate watermarked code from non-watermarked code.

### 3. Naturalness
Naturalness assesses whether the code remains fluent (in terms of Perplexity) after watermark insertion, ensuring that it appears natural to human readers.

The difference in Perplexity between non-watermarked code $C_{H}$ and watermarked code $C_{wm}$ is normalized to measure naturalness.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Ctext%7BPPL%7D%28C_%7Bwm%7D%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%7CC_%7Bwm%7D%7C%7D%20%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5E%7B%7CC_%7Bwm%7D%7C%7D%20%5Cexp%20%5Cleft%28%20-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN_j%7D%20%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7BN_j%7D%20%5Clog%20P%28w_i%5E%7B%28j%29%7D%20%7C%20w_%7B%3Ci%7D%5E%7B%28j%29%7D%29%20%5Cright%29">
</p>

- $N_j$: Number of tokens in the $j$-th code sample in $C_{wm}$.
- $P(w_i^{(j)} | w_{<i}^{(j)})$: The probability of token 
$w_{i}^{(j)}$ given its preceding context in the $j$-th sample

Then, the Naturalness score is defined as:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cmathrm%7BNaturalness%7D%28C_%7Bwm%7D%2C%20C%29%20%3D%201%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B%7C%5Ctext%7BPPL%7D%28C_%7Bwm%7D%29%20-%20%5Ctext%7BPPL%7D%28C%29%7C%7D%7B%5Ctext%7BPPL%7D%28C%29%7D">
</p>

- The Naturalness score normalizes the absolute difference in Perplexity between watermarked and non-watermarked code by the Perplexity of the original code C.
- A score closer to 1 indicates that the watermark has little effect on the natural flow of the code, meaning the watermark is well concealed.
